# my first unity project 
tank game that puts players in command of a tank, embarking on 2 missions. In each mission, players face the formidable challenge of defeating enemy tanks and emerging victorious.

Equipped with missiles and projectiles, the player must strategically aim and fire to eliminate enemy forces. Along the way, ammunition and life pickups are scattered across the battleground, providing valuable resources to replenish supplies and maintain vitality.

What sets this tank game apart is the implementation of advanced enemy AI using Unity's NavMesh system and a meticulously crafted C# script. The enemy tanks exhibit intelligent behavior, maneuvering dynamically across the terrain to outwit the player and pose a formidable challenge.

 The tank itself has been designed using Blender.
